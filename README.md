## Learning ability test for a Full Stack Developer job
Technical test done within a day after a technical interview to show my **learning ability** of new languages and frameworks.

In this case the random exercice was to do a simple project with **Python**, creating a small API with the micro web framework **Flask** (without using a Database), with **Pickle** for serializing and de-serializing the object structure.  

It is a **registration form** to register a new user, see the list of all users and getting an error message if the email is invalid.

## Usage

Create a directory to hold the virtual env and project, clone the project into the directory, create the virtual environment. Check that you have the right versions of pip and python, install flask, and run this command:  
`flask run`
